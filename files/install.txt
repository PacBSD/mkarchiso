PacBSD Install

Once the PacBSD install cd is booted you may wish to change your keyboard layout by using the following command:
kbdmap
You can also use vidcontrol to change your console resolution, to see a list of available modes:

	vidcontrol -i mode

You can get a list of the mode numbers to use in setting the resolution to whatever the mode number matches:

	vidcontrol MODE_XXX

where XXX is the mode number.


Setting up your disks

The following example is for the simplest setup.
To partition your disk with gpart the simplest way is the following:
For sata drives the naming will be ada, while for IDE it will be da. Keep in mind this for the following commands:

	Create the geom
	gpart create -s gpt da0
	gpart add -s 64k -t freebsd-boot da0

Setup a swap:
	
	gpart add -s 1g -t freebsd-swap da0

Setup a root partition.
	gpart add -t freebsd-ufs da0
	gpart bootcode -b /boot/pmbr -p /boot/gptboot -i 1 da0
	newfs -U -j -L root /dev/da0p3
	swapon /dev/da0p2

Then finish by mounting the partitions to install:
	mount /dev/da0p3 /mnt



Installing base

Once your disks are ready we can use pacstrap to install the PacBSD base.
At this point you will need the internet to fetch the packages. You can use dhclient for this:
TIP: To find the available network devices, use ifconfig

	dhclient device

You can choose between FreeBSD-init and Openrc.
FreeBSD init has more scripts such as automatic dhcp.

And fetch the base with:
	pacstrap /mnt base


onfigure your system

	arch-chroot /mnt

You'll need to manually setup your fstab at this point. Use either vi or ee for writing it.
Example of a line for swap in fstab:

	/dev/da0p2      none        swap   sw 0 0
	/dev/da0p3      /           ufs    rw,async 1 1

Setting up your timezone:

	ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/London /etc/localtime

Setting up your hostname:

	sysrc hostname="hostname" 

Setup your password:

	passwd




That is all you'll be able to reboot into a working PacBSD install.
